DeltaRepo's Acceptance Tests
============================

* Set of tests that check DeltaRepo behavior as a whole.
* Also check binary compatibility of generated files.
 * *E.g. If we have two repositories ``01`` and ``02`` both generated by ``createrepo_c`` and we create and then apply a delta on a system with the exactly the same version of the createrepo_c and all depended libraries like sqlite, gzip, bzip2, etc. The ``02`` repository generated by the delta would have exactly the same checksums of all metadata files as the original one repository!*


## Setup

At first, you need to generate a testing repositories - All testing packages and generating commands are already prepared. Just run:

    cd acceptance_tests/
    repos/regenrepos.sh

After this step, we got a example data and we could run the acceptance tests.

**Note:** You should regenerate testing data after each update of any of
dependent libraries.


## Testing

    cd acceptance_tests/
    ./test.sh


## Results

* A new directory for the current run with a sub-directory for each test
will be created.
* Some corner case tests shows warning - this is expected.
* Only basic test evaluation (based on return codes) is done automatically - Anything more sophisticated must be done manually.
